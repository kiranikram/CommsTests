Testing basic differentiable comms  

Our agents are going on vacation. However, they can only pack one item (ski boots, beach ball or umbrella)... and they are not sure what the weather will be like 
at their vacation destination. 
One agent can see part of the forecast, and another agent, another part, but on average, they cannot induvidually determine whether there will be snow, sun or rain. 
Thus they must communicate to figure out what the weather will be. 

They can only 'enjoy' their vacation if they both pack the same item!
